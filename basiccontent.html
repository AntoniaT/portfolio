    <h2>Group projects</h2>
    <p>In this theme we learned about movies and storytelling. We were taught about how to direct, film, edit, and produce our own video. There was also a part on sound and sound editing, which was fun for me, because I have done several studio recordings before and sound production and mastering sound tracks was part of my leisure activities.</p>

        <h3>What?</h3>
        <p>Create a short video and tell a story without using any words. We were given a theme and had to come up with a short story. We chose "difficult liasons" and tried to interpret this theme in a authentic and funny way, which was associated with our personal experiences.</p>

      <h3>What?</h3>
      <p>The project was making a video and introducing the rules of biking in Copenhagen. This was a very difficult project to manage, since we couldn't stick to one idea in the group. We started to work on different edges and ended up with an idea, but without proper footage.</p>
