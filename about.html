    <p id="aboutp">Graphic Designer // Illustrator // becoming a Web Designer and Developer</p>
    <p class="aboutdescription">My name is Antonia, but most people call me Toni. I was born as a dreamer and with a love and talent to draw. So I went to a high school where I graduated with a professional training in Graphic Design. But I was very insecure about my skills and the competition was discouraging, so I thought I would study something completely different and become really great at that instead.<br><br> I ended up with a Master in Law (Austria) and at yet another crossroads. Law was interesting, but it didn't make my heart jump. So I went to live in my dream city (Lisbon) and away from everything that kept me back from pursuing my dreams.

  <p class="aboutdescription1">Living in Lisbon I was making music and started working in Design again. It was also the first time I was introduced to HTML and CSS. From that point I knew that if I want to become a great designer and developer, I have to give it my all! That's why I became a student at KEA in Multimedia Design. I'm excited for the next steps!<br></p>
